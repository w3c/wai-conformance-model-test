The <i>Museum of Broken Things</i> is expanding its unique collection in a musical direction with the donation of an exciting new exhibit. This special collection, dedicated entirely to albums and songs featuring the word “broken,” has been generously gifted to the museum by an anonymous donor. The exhibit will highlight how the concept of “brokenness” has resonated with artists across genres and generations, turning personal struggles, societal fractures, and emotional pain into powerful music. Visitors will now not only be able to see objects in disrepair but also listen to the sounds of brokenness through this curated musical experience.

## Nine Inch Nails' <cite>"Broken"</cite> Takes Center Stage

At the heart of the new exhibit is Nine Inch Nails’ <i>Broken</i> EP, released in 1992. The aggressive, industrial sound of Trent Reznor’s iconic record is often viewed as a cathartic exploration of anger and frustration, with the very title symbolizing emotional and societal rupture. Known for its raw energy and intense themes, *Broken* became a defining moment for the band, with hits like “Last” and “Happiness In Slavery” expressing a visceral sense of discontent. The exhibit will feature original pressings of the album and rare footage from the band’s <cite>Broken</cite> short film, offering visitors a deep dive into the artistic vision behind this legendary EP.

## More Musical Explorations of "Broken"

The exhibit also includes a wide range of other albums and songs that feature the word “broken,” each telling its own story of heartbreak, loss, and resilience. One of the standout tracks is *"Broken Wings"* by Mr. Mister, an '80s hit that became an anthem for those mending from emotional wounds. Also featured is *"Hearts Burst into Fire"* by Bullet for My Valentine, whose lyrics lament the pain of broken relationships, and *"Broken Strings"* by James Morrison and Nelly Furtado, a duet that explores the collapse of love and the struggles to repair what’s been shattered.

In addition to these, the exhibit includes other memorable tracks like *"Broken Vow"* by Josh Groban, known for its haunting orchestration and powerful vocals. The Goo Goo Dolls’ *"Better Days"* (which includes the phrase “I wish everyone was broken”) adds a contemplative touch, reflecting on the brokenness in society. Meanwhile, Amy Winehouse’s *"Love Is a Losing Game"* explores the fragility of love, complementing the theme of emotional fracture that runs throughout the collection.

## A Global Reflection of Brokenness in Music

The new exhibit doesn’t stop at English-language songs. It also includes international pieces like *"La Vie est Belle"* by Indochine, which features the line <span lang="fr">“tout est cassé”</span> (“everything is broken”), offering a French perspective on emotional disillusionment. This diverse collection of songs and albums reflects how the theme of brokenness resonates globally, showing that the experiences of loss, failure, and redemption are universal across cultures and languages.

## A Sonic Journey Through the Fragility of Life

The addition of this musical exhibit to the Museum of Broken Things brings a new dimension to the exploration of brokenness. With songs spanning decades and genres, visitors can experience how artists have used music to process and express the fragments of their lives and emotions. The museum continues its mission to celebrate the beauty found in the broken, and this exhibit provides yet another powerful way to engage with that theme—through the universal language of music.
