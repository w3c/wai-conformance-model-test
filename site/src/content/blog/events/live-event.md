Introducing Our New Podcast Series: <cite>Stories from the Broken</cite>—Join Us for a Live Event!

The Museum of Broken Things is thrilled to announce the launch of its new podcast series, *Stories from the Broken*, where we dive deep into the untold narratives of broken objects, fractured lives, and forgotten histories. To celebrate this exciting new venture, we’re hosting a special live event that will be recorded for the podcast! Join us on [Event Date] for an evening of powerful storytelling, interviews, and live audience participation. This is your chance to be part of the museum's history while we explore what it means to live in a world filled with both beauty and brokenness.

At this live event, we’ll be featuring guest speakers who will share their personal connections to items in our museum collection—broken objects that tell stories of love, loss, resilience, and transformation. From artists who find inspiration in damaged materials to historians who uncover forgotten truths through discarded relics, our guests will guide you through the deeper meanings behind the exhibits. You’ll hear firsthand how broken things, far from being discarded, can spark conversations about who we are and how we relate to the world around us.

Audience participation will be a key part of the evening! Attendees will have the chance to ask questions, share their own stories of brokenness, and contribute to the rich dialogue about how we navigate life’s fractures. Whether it’s a broken promise, a shattered keepsake, or a lost opportunity, we invite you to be part of a collective reflection on the stories that connect us all. The most compelling moments from the night will be featured in upcoming episodes of the *Stories from the Broken* podcast, so your voice could become part of this exciting new series!

This event is not just a recording session—it’s a live, intimate experience where we come together to reflect on the fragile, beautiful nature of the human experience. Spaces are limited, so reserve your spot today and be part of a special night that will live on in the museum’s new podcast series. Come with an open heart and a friend, and leave with a deeper understanding of the power that lies in things we once thought were broken.
